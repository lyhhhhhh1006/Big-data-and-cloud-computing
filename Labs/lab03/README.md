# Lab: Parallelization with Python

## Goals

-   Building map and reduce jobs in Python using the `multiprocessing` library

The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to think about scaling up your code using multiple processors to speed up data science computation. This will help you become familiar with map-reduce concepts as we approach the use of Spark for really big data. 

## Submission

You will follow the submission process for all labs and assignments:

- Add all your requested files to the GitHub assignment repo for the appropriate deliverable.
- Submit a final commit message called "final-submission" to your repo. This is critical so that instructional team can evaluate your work. Do not change your GitHub repo after submitting the "final-submission" commit message

Your submission repo requires the following:

- `parallelization-with-python.ipynb`
- `README.md`
- `soln.json`
- `.gitignore`
- `script1.py, script2.py, script3.py`
